Test to automate
You may create an account beforehand using dummy data and use this within the test to log in

1.	Hover the Dresses tab and click Summer dresses
2.	Change the view of the products to List view
3.	Add the product to the cart
4.	Proceed to checkout
5.	Increase the quantity to two dresses
6.	Log in using your account
7.	Confirm address and confirm shipping
8.	Print to console the following info: Name of product and the price

Scenario 1:
From the above scenarios, I priortise 'Proceed to checkout' scenario as the first to automate. 
'Proceed to checkout' scenario also covers 'Add the product to the cart' scenario. From my experience, adding product to the cart and proceed to checkout are the most important features so that in future user can checkout successfully when payment system is established.
Above scenario also includes other scenarios such as 'Login to an account', 'Confirm address' and 'Confirm shipping'.
However I have noticed that there is an error occuring while automating the above end to end scenario. 
I have successfully created the account but when trying to login after proceeding the checkout it says "Unauthorised". On top of it I was getting 404 error whilst building the automation test framework.

Scenario 2:
In addition to the above high priority scenario, I choose to automate the trivial scenario 'Hover the Dresses tab and click Summer dresses'.

## Part 2: API Tests

I completed all api task with the postman, added tests for all responses. I am sending postman collection through file upload link.

Step to run postman collection from the command line -
 
 1. Installing Newman on Windows - npm install -g newman
 2. verify installation - newman --version
 3. Run collection - newman run API_Test.postman_collection.json
 4. Generate html extra report - newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5d7436ef90a5c6cff2f6 --reporters cli,htmlextra
